This repo contains one of the most popular basic level projects of Machine Learning i.e. Cartoonifier.
Pre-requisites (in cmd prompt if windows user):

1.
                                            
                                             pip install python-opencv
                 
2.

3.
                                                 pip install imageio

The code here aims to transform images into cartoon. 

It will run a GUI application which allows us to select an image from our file system and then transform it into cartoon.

The entire understanding of code is mentioned in comments itself.
To code this we have to remember that a cartoon effect has two specialties:
1. Highlighted Edges
2. Smooth colors

The detailed demonstration of the process that will happen is attached as screenshots on a download.jfif pic.
