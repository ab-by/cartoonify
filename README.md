This repo contains one of the most popular basic level projects of Machine Learning i.e. Cartoonifier.
Major pre-requisites for the same are installation of important packages in the system :
1. OpenCV 2. ImageIO 3. EasyGUI

The code here aims here to edit your image into various types. 

It will run a GUI application which allows us to select an image from our file system and then transform it into cartoon.

The entire understanding of code is mentioned in comments itself.
To code this we have to remember that a cartoon effect has two specialties:
1. Highlighted Edges
2. Smooth colors

The detailed demonstration of the process that will happen is attached as screenshots on a download.jfif pic.
